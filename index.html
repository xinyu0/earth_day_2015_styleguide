<h1>Style Guide</h1>
<p>Welcome to this style guide.<br />
Here you will find some pre-designed elements, graphics or rules to follow to help make sure the redesign of Earth Day 2015 look and feel consist. 
<br>
The website can be found at <a href="http://xinyudesign.com/earth_day_2015">Earth Day 2015 Redesign</a>.</p>

<p>
The idea behind the site is to inspire everyday people to join a local earth day event. 
<br>
the redesign is intended to add a fun vibe to it, so the brand will look cool, charismatic, and gear more towards the younger generation. 
<br>I want the website to feel like the recycling twins from portlandia. It's fun, friendly, and cool.
